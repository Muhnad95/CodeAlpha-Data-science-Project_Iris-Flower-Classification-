# 🌸 1: Iris Flower Classification

## 📌 Overview 
The goal is to classify Iris flowers into three species (*setosa, versicolor, virginica*) using machine learning.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv)
- Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width
- Target: Species

## ⚙️ Steps
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Train/test split
3. Feature scaling
4. Model training (Logistic Regression)
5. Evaluation (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix)

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy: ~95–97% (varies slightly by split)
- Confusion matrix, feature distributions visualization included

## 🚀 How to Run
  -you can run the python code locally and include the csv file
  or using the data set url to the  correct path in this part of the code :
  -at line 11:
# 1. Load dataset df = pd.read_csv("Downloads/Iris.csv")
